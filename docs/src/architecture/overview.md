# Architecture overview

This chapter covers the core design decisions for my kernel.
I will walk you through the architectural choices I made and why I made them.

We will focus on a surface-level structure and strategy.
If you want to dive into the code and see how it all works,
you will find links to the implementation details throughout the pages.
