# To-Do List

There is lots to do, but I will try and keep track
of the things that are needed to keep the kernel functional.

- [ ] Implement a Slab Allocator (or similar object cache).
- [ ] Ensure buddy allocator is functional.
- [ ] Figure out On-Demand Paging for the User Space.
- [ ] Create a User Space that can be allocated on Syscalls.
- [ ] Writing documentation on the logic of the Buddy Allocator
- [ ] Explanation on why the buddy allocator should manage the physical address directly
