# Introduction

Welcome to my Kernel From Scratch (KFS) project documentation! This repository contains my implementation of the École 42 "Kernel From Scratch" curriculum, consisting of 10 progressive projects designed to explore and understand kernel architecture from the ground up in the language C.

> ⚠️ This project is in early stage development. It's not yet ready for production use.

## This Book

This book contains more information about my technical approach & a more blog-style writing about each project to get to the current point I am at.
