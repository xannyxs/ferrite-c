Introduction
------------

Welcome to my Kernel From Scratch (KFS) project documentation! This repository contains my implementation of the Ã‰cole 42 "Kernel From Scratch" curriculum, consisting of 10 progressive projects designed to explore and understand kernel architecture from the ground up.

Technical Requirements
----------------------

* Target Architecture: i386 (x86_32)
* Build System: Custom Makefile required
* Programming Language: Not restricted to any specific language
* Compiler Flags:

  - ``-nostdlib``: Prevents linking with standard library
  - ``-fnodefaultlibs``: Excludes default library functions
  - ``-fno-stack-protector``: Disables stack protection mechanisms

* Custom Linker: Implementation of a custom linker is mandatory
* No cheating! All code must be original; no copying + pasting allowed

Documentation Structure
-----------------------

Each project in this repository is documented with:

#. Project Goals and Requirements
#. Technical Approach and Implementation Details
#. Challenges Encountered and Solutions
#. Conclusions and Lessons Learned

Feel free to join each project's documentation to understand the journey of building a kernel from scratch.
The projects are organized sequentially, with each building upon the knowledge and components developed in previous sections.
